# Markdown Converter

This is a simple static web application that converts Markdown text to HTML. It uses the `marked` library for Markdown parsing and `highlight.js` for code block syntax highlighting.

## How it Works

The application takes a predefined Markdown string and renders it as HTML within the `#markdown-output` div. Code blocks within the Markdown will be automatically highlighted.

## Features

*   Converts Markdown to HTML.
*   Syntax highlighting for code blocks using highlight.js.
*   Modern and clean interface.

## Deployment

This application is designed to be deployed on GitHub Pages. Simply push the `index.html`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE` files to a GitHub repository, and GitHub Pages will handle the rest.
